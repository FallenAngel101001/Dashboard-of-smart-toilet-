#Dashboard of smart toilet

what is that ? 

This app can show the weather and time , just like the dashboard of the mall ! you can see the sample.jpg on above 

This is the application app which is made by react native , so it can run on android and ios










How can use it ? 1 . 

you have to make sure you have the correct react native environment , so i suggest to use the expo , and you can seek the chatgpt to solve it ! >.< 

2 . you can download my file , and run ---- npm run web 

3 . if you want to run on android , you have to download the expo in your phone , connecting the same wifi , and the expo will automatically connect the app , and you need to run the command --- npm run android

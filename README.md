# This is the application app which is made by react native , so it can run on android and ios 

#  This app can show the weather and time , just like the dashboard of the mall 
! you can see the sample.jpg on above

#How can use it ?
1 . you have to make sure you have the correct react native environment , so i suggest to use the expo , and you can seek the chatgpt to solve it ! >.<
2 . you can download my file , and run  ----        npm run web
3 . if you want to run on android , you have to download the expo in your phone , connecting the same wifi , and the expo will automatically connect the app , and you need to run the command   --- npm run android 


#How the time work ?

#How the weather work?
